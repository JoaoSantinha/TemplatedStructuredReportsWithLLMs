Local tumor status:\n\
    ● Morphology: [solid-polypoid/solid-(semi-)annular/mucinous]\n\
    ● Circumferential tumor involvement: from [ ] to [ ] o’clock\n\
    ● Distance from anorectal junction to lower pole of tumor: [ ] cm\n\
    ● Relation to anterior peritoneal reflection: [below/above/crossing]\n\
    ● Tumor length: [ ] cm\n\
    ● T-stage: [T1–2/T3ab/T3 cd/T4]\n\
    If T4, based on growth into: [ ]\n\
    ● Sphincter invasion: [no/yes, internal sphincter only/yes, internal sphincter + intersphincteric plane/yes,internal + external sphincter]\n\
    If yes, lowest part of invasion [upper/middle/distal] third of anal canal\n\
Mesorectal fascia (MRF) involvement:\n\
    ● Shortest distance between tumor and MRF: [ ] mm, indicating a [free (> 2 mm)/threatened-involved (≤ 2 mm)] margin\n\
    ● Circumferential location of shortest distance between tumor and MRF: [ ] o’clock\n\
Lymph nodes and tumor deposits:\n\
    ● Total number of lymph nodes: [ ]\n\
    ● Total number of suspicious lymph nodes: [ ], of which [ ] within mesorectum, [ ] extramesorectal    \n\
    Optional to include in report:\n\
        ○ [ ] nodes with short axis≥9mm\n\
        ○ [ ] nodes with short axis 5–8 mm and at least 2 morphologic suspicious criteria\n\
        ○ [ ] nodes with short axis 5 mm and all 3 morphologic suspicious criteria\n\
        ○ [ ] mucinous nodes (any size)\n\
    N-stage: [N0/N + ]\n\
    Number of tumor deposits within the mesorectum: [ ]\n\
Extramural vascular invasion (EMVI):\n\
    ● Presence of EMVI: [yes/no]
